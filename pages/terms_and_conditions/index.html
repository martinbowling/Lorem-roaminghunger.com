A Notice to Roaming Hunger should be sent to: Roaming Hunger, Inc., Attn: Legal,  8228 W. Sunset Blvd, Suite B, West Hollywood, CA 90046. After the Notice is received, you and Roaming Hunger may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and Roaming Hunger do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.</p><p class="font-light text-sm my-2">Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“<strong>ADR Provider</strong>”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the consumer arbitrations held before the AAA are available online at <a class="text-blue font-bold" href="http://www.adr.org" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.<!-- --> </p><p class="font-light text-sm my-2"><u>If you are a consumer and not a Roaming Hunger Vendor</u>: Notwithstanding the foregoing, you have the right to opt out of the arbitration provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by mailing written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: Roaming Hunger, Inc., Attn: Legal, 8228 W. Sunset Blvd, Suite B, West Hollywood, CA 90046. To be effective, your opt-out notice must be postmarked within 30 days of your first use of Roaming Hunger’s Website. If you timely send this notice, then the obligation to arbitrate disputes will not apply to either party and you must litigate pursuant to the subparagraph below. If you do not timely send this notice, then you agree to be bound by this Arbitration Agreement in its entirety. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, if the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that Roaming Hunger made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, Roaming Hunger will pay you the greater of the award or US $2,500.</p><p class="font-light text-sm my-2">If you or Roaming Hunger pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.</p><p class="font-light text-sm my-2">If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Roaming Hunger, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Roaming Hunger.</p><p class="font-light text-sm my-2">THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT (OTHER THAN A SMALL CLAIMS COURT) AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and Roaming Hunger in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND ROAMING HUNGER WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p><p class="font-light text-sm my-2">ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.<!-- --> </p><p class="font-light text-sm my-2">If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Terms shall continue in full force and effect.</p><p class="font-light text-sm my-2">Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.</p><p class="font-light text-sm my-2">This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your user relationship with Roaming Hunger.</p><p class="font-light text-sm my-2">Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Roaming Hunger may bring an individual action in small claims court.</p><p class="font-light text-sm my-2">Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency injunctive relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.</p><p class="font-light text-sm my-2">In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, and for claims involving users who have delivered an effective opt-out notice pursuant to the subparagraph above, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Los Angeles County, California, for such purpose.</p><p class="font-light text-sm my-2">Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, we agree that if Roaming Hunger makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, such change will not apply to any individual claim(s) for which you had already provided notice (to Roaming Hunger) prior to the effective date of the change.</p><h2 class="font-normal text-2xl mt-2">Choice of Law</h2><p class="font-light text-sm my-2">These Terms shall be governed by the laws of California, excluding any conflict of laws principles that would require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.</p><h2 class="font-normal text-2xl mt-2">Claims</h2><p class="font-light text-sm my-2">YOU AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICE MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES.

Any waiver of any provision of these Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by Roaming Hunger.
